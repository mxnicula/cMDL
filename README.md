Crypto LEU is a decentralized financial system aimed at providing a better solution for money supply inside a country.

Crypto LEU (cMDL) implements the ERC20 token standard (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). Therefore it can be feely transferred between accounts and cannot be locked or frozen.

Crypto LEU employs an straightforward emissions system. Every citizen of the Republic of Moldova is eligible to claim, once a week a certain emission amount specified in the smart contract.

This is the only way new cMDL enter into circulation. Every participant is guranteed to be able to claim the emission.

A burn fee is employed to combat inflation. Initially at 3%, the fee is charged on every transfer to the receiver.

Paramters of the system can be changed by a majority vote with (30% participation rate) through the votting smart contract.
