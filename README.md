Crypto LEU (cMDL) is an ERC20 token version of the Moldovan LEU (MDL)

Workflow:
1. Each user having a Facebook account with the hometown set in the Republic of Moldova is eligible to get registered in the cMDL system. During each registration the Facebook ID of the registered user will be recorded on the blockchain for future verifications.
2. Each person registered in the cMDL systems has the ability to claim a specific amount of cMDL each emission period (approx. one a week)
3. The emission amount and the emission period are set by the admin account
TODO: admin account must be a smart contract that is allowed to change parameters inside the cMDL contract based on a vote of the majority of cMDL holders. The voting rules will be difined in the admin contract (indiciatively, a 30% participation rate with a simple majority of 50% + 1). Percentage votes are counted based on the cMDL in holding as proportion of the total supply. Eg. if total supply is 100 cMDL and you own 1 cMDL, your vote will represent 1% of the votes.
4. Registrations are performed by the operatorAccount. The operatorAccount can be changed by the adminAccount using the same voting system described in point 3.
